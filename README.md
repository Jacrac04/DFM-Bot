## About The Project
This is a Bot for [drfrostmaths.com](drfrostmaths.com). If you like this please Star it on Github, it really helps, thanks.
It was originally based of [AK163631's Answer Tool](https://github.com/AK163631/DFM-Answer-Tool). This is for educational purposes only.

### Warning: Dr Frost Will Ban You
<b> Update: </b>
I got banned on a different account after doing 10 questions. I beilive that it bans based on time now. I recommend not using the bot.

I got banned after 300 questions. The only way to get your account un-banned is to get your teacher to contact Dr Frost. Because my account is banned I will no longer be able to test this. If you do 300 questions on one aaid/link or in one go using auto submit or manual submit or by yourself without a bot you will get banned. I believe Dr Frost does not have a proper anti-cheat they just use question number as a makeshift anti-cheat.

## Getting Started
### The Interface
![Image of Annotated Interface](https://github.com/Jacrac04/DFM-Bot/blob/master/images/annotatedInterface.png)
### Setup And Use For Windows
1. Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Jacrac04/DFM-Bot/releases)
2. Run the .exe
     - If it gets blocked by your antivirus or Windows, I recommend that you DO NOT run it. Instead use repl or download the source code and run that.
4. Enter your login details - Ensure that your [Dr frost account](https://www.drfrostmaths.com/account.php) is not linked to google or another service. [(Check here)](https://www.drfrostmaths.com/account.php)
5. Enter a question url or the AAID
    - This should look like `https://www.drfrostmaths.com/do-question.php?aaid=12345678` or `12345678`
    - make sure that there is nothing else like `qnum=5` in it.
6. Select manual or auto submit.
    - Auto submit lets you enter the amount of the questions for it to answer and it will go through and answer them for you. After clicking start, if you refresh your Dr forst page you should see questions being answered.
    - Manual submit will give you the answer for the currrent question and then you can enter it yourself. 
7. Click start.


### Setup And Use For Repl
1. Go to the [replit.com site](https://replit.com/@Jacrac04/DFM-Bot#main.py) for this project and click fork. It is important you create your own version as repl shares one instance between everyone, so people may be able to get your Dr Frost password. Once you have done this you can run it.
2. Enter your login details - Ensure that your [Dr frost account](https://www.drfrostmaths.com/account.php) is not linked to google or another service. [(Check here)](https://www.drfrostmaths.com/account.php)
3. Enter a question url or the AAID.
    - This should look like `https://www.drfrostmaths.com/do-question.php?aaid=12345678` or `12345678`
    - make sure that there is nothing else like `qnum=5` in it.
4. Select manual or auto submit.
    - Auto submit lets you enter the amount of the questions for it to answer and it will go through and answer them for you. You can also add a delay time between questions. After clicking start, if you refresh your Dr forst page you should see questions being answered.
    - Manual submit will give you the answer for the currrent question and then you can enter it yourself. 
5. Click start.


The repl site works however it is slower and you will have a better user expeciernce is you run it using the exe or source code on your own machine.


### Tips
* IMPORTANT: Please read [this](https://github.com/Jacrac04/DFM-Bot/issues/1) before using
* I recommend that you change your Dr Frost password to something unique that you dont use for anything else before using this.
* If you use a 'keep going till i say' question url the only way to stop the bot is by closing the window or terminating the process
* After about 15 on one 'skill' you will reach 'master' level. You can keep answering questions on that skill but you will not gain points. So if you want to get lots of points go to on Dr frost practice --> key skills then select lots of skills which you haven't done before then practise them. 


## Bugs, Issues And Requests
Please report any issue or bugs [here](https://github.com/Jacrac04/DFM-Bot/issues/new/choose)
See the [open issues](https://github.com/Jacrac04/DFM-Bot/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
### Known Issues
* The delay is only between questions and does not actually increase the time taken answering a question.
