## About The Project
This is a Bot for [drfrostmaths.com](drfrostmaths.com). If you like this please Star it on Github, it really helps, thanks.
It was originally based of [AK163631's Answer Tool](https://github.com/AK163631/DFM-Answer-Tool) 

### Warning: Dr Frost Will Ban You
I got banned after 300 questions.

## Getting Started
### The Interface
![Image of Annotated Interface](https://github.com/Jacrac04/DFM-Bot/blob/master/images/annotatedInterface.png)
### Setup And Use For Windows
1. Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Jacrac04/DFM-Bot/releases)
2. Run the .exe
3. Enter your login details - Ensure that your [Dr frost account](https://www.drfrostmaths.com/account.php) is not linked to google or another service. [(Check here)](https://www.drfrostmaths.com/account.php)
4. Enter a question url or the AAID
    - This should look like `https://www.drfrostmaths.com/do-question.php?aaid=12345678` or `12345678`
    - make sure that there is nothing else like `qnum=5` in it.
5. Select manual or auto submit.
    - Auto submit lets you enter the amount of the questions for it to answer and it will go through and answer them for you. After clicking start, if you refresh your Dr forst page you should see questions being answered.
    - Manual submit will give you the answer for the currrent question and then you can enter it yourself. 
6. Click start.


### Setup And Use For Repl
1. Go to the [repl.it site](https://repl.it/@Jacrac04/DFM-Bot#main.py) for this project and click fork. It is important you create your own version as repl shares one instance between everyone, so people may be able to get your Dr Frost password. Once you have done this you can run it.
2. Enter your login details - Ensure that your [Dr frost account](https://www.drfrostmaths.com/account.php) is not linked to google or another service. [(Check here)](https://www.drfrostmaths.com/account.php)
3. Enter a question url or the AAID.
    - This should look like `https://www.drfrostmaths.com/do-question.php?aaid=12345678` or `12345678`
    - make sure that there is nothing else like `qnum=5` in it.
4. Select manual or auto submit.
    - Auto submit lets you enter the amount of the questions for it to answer and it will go through and answer them for you. After clicking start, if you refresh your Dr forst page you should see questions being answered.
    - Manual submit will give you the answer for the currrent question and then you can enter it yourself. 
5. Click start.


The repl site works however it is slower and you will have a better user expeciernce is you run it using the exe or source code on your own machine.


### Tips
* IMPORTANT: Please read [this](https://github.com/Jacrac04/DFM-Bot/issues/1) before using
* If you use a 'keep going till i say' question url the only way to stop the bot is by closing the window or terminating the process
* After about 15 on one 'skill' you will reach 'master' level. You can keep answering questions on that skill but you will not gain points. So if you want to get lots of points go to on Dr frost practice --> key skills then select lots of skills which you haven't done before then practise them.
